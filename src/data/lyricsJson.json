Miłosny ogień\nPłonie w nas, płonie w nas, jak suchy las\nKochaj mnie!!, Kochaj mnie!! Mocniej i mocniej\nNa nic tu, na nic tu ogniowa straż\n\nSamotnemu sercu które tylko wątpi\nBo nieprzytulane zmarzło na lód\nPromień obietnicy taki lód roztopi\nWyjdzie jak z niewoli kochania głód\n\nPali się!! Pali się!! Miłosny ogień\nPłonie w nas, płonie w nas, jak suchy las\nKochaj mnie!!, Kochaj mnie!! Mocniej i mocniej\nNa nic tu, na nic tu ogniowa straż\n\nPorzucone serce które nic nie czuje\nŚwiatu obojętne, twarde jak głaz\nAle gdy przyspieszy, samo się rozkuje\nDoda oczom blasku, nadrobi czas\n\nPali się!! Pali się!! Miłosny ogień\nPłonie w nas, płonie w nas, jak suchy las\nKochaj mnie!!, Kochaj mnie!! Mocniej i mocniej\nNa nic tu, na nic tu ogniowa straż\n\nFire! Fire! Fire of love!\nBurns in you, burns in me\nBurns us alive\nLove me now! Love me now!\nHarder and harder\nTake me there, be the air I need to survive",
